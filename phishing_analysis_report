1. Sender Email Analysis

Displayed name:Support (generic, no personalization).
Actual address:support@msupdate.net` → This is not an official Microsoft domain (`microsoft.com` or `outlook.com`).
Red flag: Domain msupdate.net` is suspicious and could be designed to look related to Microsoft.

---

2. Email Content & Urgency

The email claims **your Microsoft password was changed.
It urges you to act immediately if this wasn't you → common urgency tactic in phishing.

---

3. Suspicious Links

The text includes links like **"Reset your password" and "Review your security info".
Without clicking, hovering would likely reveal a non-Microsoft domain redirecting to a fake login page.
Red flag: Microsoft password reset links should always lead to login.live.com or account.microsoft.com.

4. Email Personalization

No greeting with your real name.
Refers to "your account" instead of identifying it fully → a typical phishing pattern to make it generic.

---

5. Technical Clues

IP address provided: 77.196.86.10 — could be a fabricated detail to make the email look legitimate.
Includes details like Country, Platform, Browser — these are meant to make the email seem credible but can be fake.

Official emails usually contain branded headers, consistent styling, and copyright footer.

---

Email claims to be Microsoft but domain is unrelated.
No official Microsoft logo or secure email footer.
