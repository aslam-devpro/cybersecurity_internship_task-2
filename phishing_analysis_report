3. Email Content & Urgency

It urges you to act immediately if this wasn't you → common urgency tactic in phishing.

---

4. Suspicious Links

The text includes links like **"Reset your password" and "Review your security info".
Without clicking, hovering would likely reveal a non-Microsoft domain redirecting to a fake login page.

No greeting with your real name.
Refers to "your account" instead of identifying it fully → a typical phishing pattern to make it generic.
