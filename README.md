📧 **Phishing Email Analysis Report**  
📅 **Analysis Date:** Tue Aug 12, 2025  
🧰 **Tools Used:**  
- **Email Header Analyzer** (MXToolbox, Google Admin Toolbox) – For decoding and inspecting the email’s metadata.  
- **Manual Inspection** – For identifying phishing characteristics in the email body.  

## 📄 Summary of Analyzed Email
| Field         | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Subject**  | Microsoft account password change |
| **From**     | "Microsoft Support" <support@msupdate.net> |
| **To**       | victim@example.com |
| **Header Status** | SPF: **Fail**, DKIM: **None**, DMARC: **Fail** |
| **Open Links** | "Reset your password" → Suspicious, non-Microsoft domain |

## 🛠️ Email Header (Simulated for Analysis)
```
Return-Path: <support@msupdate.net>
Received: from mail.fakeisp.net (mail.fakeisp.net [203.0.113.45])
        by mx.google.com with ESMTP id x9si9999999qke.199.2025.08.11.04.09.00
        for <victim@example.com>;
        Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:09:00 -0700 (PDT)
Received-SPF: fail (google.com: domain of msupdate.net does not designate 203.0.113.45 as permitted sender) client-ip=203.0.113.45;
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
       spf=fail (google.com: domain of msupdate.net does not designate 203.0.113.45 as permitted sender) smtp.mailfrom=support@msupdate.net;
       dkim=none;
       dmarc=fail (p=REJECT sp=REJECT dis=NONE) header.from=msupdate.net
Message-ID: <20250811040900.88888@mail.fakeisp.net>
From: "Microsoft Support" <support@msupdate.net>
To: victim@example.com
Subject: Microsoft account password change
Date: Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:09:00 -0700
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

## 🚨 Analysis of Findings
✅ **Domain Spoofing:** The sender domain (`msupdate.net`) is not an official Microsoft domain.  
✅ **Authentication Failures:** SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all fail, indicating the email is not from a verified source.  
✅ **Urgency Tactic:** Warns about account changes to pressure the recipient into quick action.  
✅ **Suspicious Links:** Likely lead to phishing pages impersonating Microsoft login.  
✅ **Generic Greeting:** No personalization; refers to “your account” instead of the recipient’s name.  

## 🔐 Security Implications
| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Credential Theft | Fake login page could steal Microsoft account credentials. |
| Malware Delivery | Links or attachments could download malicious software. |
| Identity Theft | Stolen credentials could be used for broader attacks. |
| Phishing Chain | Email could be part of a larger spear-phishing campaign. |

## 🛡️ Recommendations
1. **Do not click** any links in suspicious emails.  
2. **Verify** the sender’s domain before acting.  
3. Use **SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation** to detect spoofed emails.  
4. Educate users on **hovering over links** to check their actual destination.  
5. Report phishing attempts to Microsoft and email providers.  

## 📌 Notes
- The suspicious header was **simulated** for educational purposes; it does not contain active malicious content.  
- The email body in this task matched common phishing patterns: urgency, spoofed branding, generic greeting, and fake links.
